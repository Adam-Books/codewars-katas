# codewars-katas
All my CodeWars katas to constantly train and improve my algorithm thinking

## Repo structure
There's a folder for each level (kyu) with katas (algorithms) having:
  * Title
  * Description
  * Examples
  * Notes
  * Link
  * Long Solution
  * Short Solution
  * Test to pass

> There is a `boilerplate.js` to create a new kata with the info above.

Also not every kata has a long or short solution.
 
## Dependencies 
* [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) for using some utility
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code-formatting
* [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) for linting.

I also use [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com) Pro Edition for rapid prototyping that runs over the last Node.js version.
I didn't use a testing framework like Jest because the plattform has one built-in with several test-cases.

## Personal Challenge
Try to solve 5 katas a day from kyu 8 to 5, ordered from most completed:
* [8 kyu - 322 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [7 kyu - 1298 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-7&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [6 kyu - 1262 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-6&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [5 kyu - 480 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-5&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)


I'll begin to do katas with kyu 4 to 1 when having lots of experience with katas with kyu 8 to 5.

* [4 kyu - 169 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-4&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [3 kyu - 60 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-3&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [2 kyu - 29 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-2&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [1 kyu - 15 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-1&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
