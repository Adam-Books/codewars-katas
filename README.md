# codewars-katas
All my CodeWars katas to constantly train and improve my algorithm thinking

![CodeWars](https://simpleicons.org/icons/codewars.svg "CodeWars")


## Repo structure
There's a folder for each level (kyu) with katas (algorithms) having:
  * Title
  * Description
  * Examples
  * Notes
  * Link
  * Long Solution
  * Short Solution
  * Test to pass

> There is a `boilerplate.js` to create a new kata.
 
## Dependencies
As dependencies I have Lodash to try something quickly, Prettier for code-formatting and ESlint for linting.
I didn't use a testing framework like Jest because the plattform has one built-in.

## Personal Challenge
Try to solve 5 katas a day from level 8 to 4, ordered from most completed:
* [8 kyu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [7 kyu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-7&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [6 kyu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-6&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [5 kyu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-5&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [4 kyu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-4&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
