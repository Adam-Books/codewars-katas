## What is a kata?

A kata basically is an algorithm you have to solve in any prgramming language you desire.

## What's kyu?

Kyu digit determines kata's difficulty level as well as user's rank on a website.

* 1 kyu, 2 kyu - Proficient
* 3 kyu, 4 kyu - Competent
* 5 kyu, 6 kyu - Novice
* 7 kyu, 8 kyu - Beginner

## Node.js ES6+ Support

The current Node versions [available](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Language-JavaScript) are the following:

* [Node.js v6.11.0](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node6_5)
* [Node.js v8.1.3](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node8_7)

## Purpose

Doing lot of katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. Also could help you to go with more confidence to interviews. I highly recommend this [Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook) which is a carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview.

## Pair Programming

Doing pair-programming is a great exercise to learn from others as well to practice communicational skills. So if you are around Buenos Aires and want to do some katas just hit me up with an issue and let's get together at some coffee.

## Main Goal

By the end of 2018 I hope to have almost all katas from 8 to 5 kyu. Check out my [progress](https://codewars-progress.now.sh).

## Repository Structure

There's a folder for each kyu (rank) with a folder per kata (algorithm)

* 8-kyu

  * Mr. Freeze
  * ...

* 7-kyu
  * Binary Addition
  * ...

Each kata folder has inside two files

* `index.js`
  * Title
  * Description
  * Examples
  * Notes
  * Kata Link
  * Discuss Link
  * Solutions Link
  * Long Solution
  * Short Solution
  * Function Exports

- `index.test.js`
  * With one or more test cases

## Create a new Kata

To generate a new folder with a `index.js` and `index.test.js` run

`> ./new.sh [kata-name]`

## Test your Might

If you want to test in watch mode all katas run

```bash
 yarn test-watch
```

If you want to test only a particular kyu rank run

```bash
 yarn test-watch -- /6-kyu
```

## Development Dependencies

* [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) and [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) for using some utility
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code-formatting
* [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for pre-commit hook
* [Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jest) for types definitions
* [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) for code-linting
* [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for testing

I also use [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com) Pro Edition for rapid prototyping that runs over the last Node.js version.
If you are using Quokka Pro you have this helpful feature called [Live Comments](https://medium.com/@artem.govorov/using-live-code-comments-to-quickly-measure-code-performance-with-wallaby-js-and-quokka-js-7931a896133)

## Personal Challenge

Try to solve all katas from 8 kyu first then go to the next kyu until 5 kyu.

* [8 kyu - 349 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [7 kyu - 1461 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-7&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [6 kyu - 1490 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-6&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [5 kyu - 603 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-5&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)

I'll begin to do katas with kyu 4 to 1 when I finish all katas from above.

* [4 kyu - 169 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-4&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [3 kyu - 60 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-3&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [2 kyu - 29 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-2&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [1 kyu - 15 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-1&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)

## Tips

1.  Katas has `tags` that could help you in advance to know what to use.
    For example you could solve this kata using regular expressions.

    ![Codewars tags](https://image.ibb.co/ekxm96/www_codewars_com_kata_search_my_languages_q_r_7_xids_completed_beta_false_order_by_total_completed_desc.png)

2.  Katas could have some issues that goes beyond your implementation. If you're stuck check the `Issues`.
    Just click where it says `1 Issue Reported` above the `Instructions`.

    ![Codewars issues](https://image.ibb.co/b65pU6/www_codewars_com_kata_sort_the_gift_code_train_javascript.png)

3.  Finally check the `discussions` in case the Instructions aren't really clear.
    Click on the `Discuss` button under the `Sample Tests`.

    ![Codewars issues](https://image.ibb.co/j6okmm/www_codewars_com_kata_sort_the_gift_code_train_javascript_1.png)

4.  After you submit your final solution check the Solutions to learn from other alternatives. If you don't understand them you can leave a comment or check the discussions of each one. Try to learn from these solutions and improve your current one or create a Short Solution of your own.

5.  If you check my solutions the "Long Solution" maybe is longer than the "Short Solution" but is more readable.
