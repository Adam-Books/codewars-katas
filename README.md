# codewars-katas

All my CodeWars katas to constantly train and improve my algorithm thinking

## Repo structure

There's a folder for each level (kyu) with katas (algorithms) having:

* Title
* Description
* Examples
* Notes
* Link
* Long Solution
* Short Solution
* Test to pass

> There is a `boilerplate.js` to create a new kata with the info above.

Also not every kata has a long or short solution.

## Dependencies

* [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) for using some utility
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code-formatting
* [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) for linting.

I also use [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com) Pro Edition for rapid prototyping that
runs over the last Node.js version. I didn't use a testing framework like Jest
because the plattform has one built-in with several test-cases.

## Complementary resources

In lot of katas you could use the power of Regular Expresions (RegEx) to save
code and time. This course:
[Breaking the Ice With Regular Expressions](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/breaking-the-ice-with-regular-expressions)
by CodeSchool it's great to getting started. JavaScript katas has support for
Node 6.11.0 and 8.1.3 so you could use ES6/ES2015 that will help you a lot. To
get started with ES6 I recommend this
[cheatsheet](https://github.com/mbeaudru/modern-js-cheatsheet) and
[ES6.io](https://es6.io) course by Wes Bos.

## Personal Challenge

Try to solve 5 katas a day from kyu 8 to 5, ordered from most completed:

* [8 kyu - 322 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [7 kyu - 1298 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-7&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [6 kyu - 1262 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-6&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [5 kyu - 480 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-5&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)

I'll begin to do katas with kyu 4 to 1 when having lots of experience with katas
with kyu 8 to 5.

* [4 kyu - 169 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-4&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [3 kyu - 60 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-3&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [2 kyu - 29 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-2&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [1 kyu - 15 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-1&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
