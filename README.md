## What is a kata?

A kata basically is an algorithm you have to solve in any prgramming language you desire.

## What's kyu?

Kyu digit determines kata's difficulty level as well as user's rank on a website.

* 1 kyu, 2 kyu - Proficient
* 3 kyu, 4 kyu - Competent
* 5 kyu, 6 kyu - Novice
* 7 kyu, 8 kyu - Beginner

## Purpose

Doing lot of katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. Also could help you to go with more confidence to interviews. I highly recommend this [Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook) which is a carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview.

## Pair Programming

Doing pair-programming is a great exercise to learn from others as well as practice communicational skills. So if you are around Buenos Aires and want to do some katas just hit me up with an issue or send me an email and let's get together at some coffee.

## Main Goal

By the end of 2018 I hope to have almost all katas from 8 to 5 kyu ðŸ¤ž

## Repository Structure

There's a folder for each kyu (rank) with a folder per kata (algorithm)

* 8-kyu

  * Mr. Freeze
  * ...

* 7-kyu
  * Binary Addition
  * ...
* 6-kyu
  * Bit Counting
  * ...
* 5-kyu
  * Break camelCase
  * ...

Each kata folder has inside two files

* `index.js`
  * Title\*
  * Description\*
  * Examples
  * Notes
  * Kata Link\*
  * Discuss Link\*
  * Solutions Link\*
  * Long Solution\*
  * Short Solution
  * Function Exports\*

- `index.test.js`
  * With one or more test cases

## Create a new Kata

To generate a new `index.js` and `index.test.js` run

`> ./new.sh [kata-name]`

## Test your Might

If you want to test in watch mode all katas run

```bash
 yarn test-watch
```

If you want to test only a particular kyu rank run

```bash
 yarn test-watch -- /6-kyu
```

## Development Dependencies

* [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) and [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) for using some utility
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code-formatting
* [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for pre-commit hook
* [Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jest) for types definitions
* [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) for code-linting
* [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for testing

I also use [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com) Pro Edition for rapid prototyping that runs over the last Node.js version.
If you are using Quokka Pro you have this helpful feature called [Live Comments](https://medium.com/@artem.govorov/using-live-code-comments-to-quickly-measure-code-performance-with-wallaby-js-and-quokka-js-7931a896133)

## Personal Challenge

Try to solve 5 katas a day from kyu 8 to 5, sorted by most completed and filtered by no completed

* [8 kyu - 322 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [7 kyu - 1298 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-7&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [6 kyu - 1262 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-6&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [5 kyu - 480 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-5&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)

I'll begin to do katas with kyu 4 to 1 when having lots of experience with katas with kyu 8 to 5.

* [4 kyu - 169 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-4&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [3 kyu - 60 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-3&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [2 kyu - 29 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-2&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)
* [1 kyu - 15 total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r%5B%5D=-1&xids=completed&beta=false&order_by=total_completed+desc)

## Tips

1. Katas has `tags` that could help you in advance to know what to use.
   For example you could solve this kata using regular expressions.

2. Katas could have some issues that goes beyond your implementation. If you're stuck check the `Issues`.
   Just click where it says `1 Issue Reported` above the `Instructions`.

3. Finally check the `discussions` in case the Instructions aren't really clear.
   Click on the `Discuss` button under the `Sample Tests`.
