  Title:
    What dominates your array?

  Description:
    A zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers is given. The dominator of array arr is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of arr.

    For example, consider array arr such that arr = [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3].
    The dominator of arr is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of arr and 5 is more than a half of 8.

    Write a function dominator(arr) that, given a zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers, returns the dominator of arr.
    The function should return âˆ’1 if array does not have a dominator. All values in arr will be >=0.

// Long Solution
/*
const dominator = arr => {
  const repetitions = arr.reduce((acc, number) => ({ ...acc, [number]: (acc[number] || 0) + 1 }), {})
  const maxRepetitions = Math.max(...Object.values(repetitions))
  const [dominator] = Object.entries(repetitions).find(([number, repetitions]) => repetitions === maxRepetitions)

  return maxRepetitions > arr.length / 2 ? Number(dominator) : -1
}
*/

// Improved Solution
const dominator = arr => {
  const halfLength = arr.length / 2
  const repetitions = arr.reduce((acc, number) => ({ ...acc, [number]: (acc[number] || 0) + 1 }), {})

  for (const number in repetitions) {
    if (repetitions[number] > halfLength) return Number(number)
  }

  return -1
}

// Function Export
module.exports = dominator
